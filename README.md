# Web Freelancing Repository
A repository of web development projects I created for other people. 
I received their permission to post files on this continually updating repository.

## How to use on your site: (assuming you have a server and domain running)

Note: These sites are mainly built for Github Pages! So I am assuming you have a working index.html at least!

STEPS:
1) Open the folder you want to access on this repository and click the **Clone or Download then Download Zip** button
2) Unzip the file and copy the index.html text into your site's existing main/index HTML file (replace existing text)
3) Make sure there are no other folders or duplicate names then click the **Upload Files** button
4) (Works best on Chrome) Drag and drop all of the other files, excluding index.html, into your website file system or repository
5) Wait about 5 minutes then go to your domain or **yourusername.github.io** to check if the site is up and running
6) If you have errors or something is not loading, **CONTACT ME!**
